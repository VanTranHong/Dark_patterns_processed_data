Bui 1g, Managing, and evaluating Machine Learning workflows

eC MTurk can be a great way to minimize the costs and time required for each stage of ML development. It is easy to collect and annotate the massive amounts of data
required for training machine learning (ML) models with MTurk. Building an efficient machine learning model also requires continuous iterations and corrections.
Another usage of MTurk for ML development is human-in-the-loop (HITL), where human feedback is used to help validate and retrain your model. An example is
drawing bounding boxes to build high-quality datasets for computer vision models, where the task might be too ambiguous for a purely mechanical solution and too
vast for even a large team of human experts.

“At Al2, we're pushing the state of the art of Artificial Intelligence, which often requires human-annotated data to train
¥ new systems and measure our progress. In particular, we use crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk to

build datasets that help our models learn common sense knowledge, which Is often necessary to answer basic questions
that are easy for humans but still quite hard for machines. Amazon Mechanical Turk provides a flexible platform that
(@) enables us to harness human knowledge to advance machine learning research.”

ALLEN INSTITUTE = Michael Schmitz, Director of Engineering, Allen Institute for Al
for ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

 

ess process outsourcing

Alarge, seemingly overwhelming task can sometimes be transformed into a set of smaller, more manageable microtasks that can each be accomplished
independently. Crowdsourcing can be an efficient organizational strategy to hamess innovation and agility by distributing work to Internet users. Businesses or
developers can use MTurk to access thousands of on-demand workers—and then integrate the results of that work directly into their business processes and systems.
Common examples include the moderation of web and social media content, categorization of products or images, and the collection of data from websites or other
resources.

“The F&B industry has always operated at the mercy of changing tastes and preferences of consumers. Our goal Is to
surface consumer insights and spot emerging trends, so our clients can effectively respond with effective strategies.
Workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk respond to our requests to gather information from menus, websites, and other
channels. We are able to leverage these human collective insights to better understand customer needs and uncover
important market trends.”

space again, and with the supply chain crunch easing, EV production
rates will ramp significantly in 2023. The delivery of the Tesla semi
will shift some attention toward commercial vehicles, with adoption
constrained by availability of battery materials and charging

infrastructure.

The Holistic View of Life on Earth.

One-Life aims to raise awareness and and promote environmental consciousness for our fragile ecosystem including animals of all species across the globe. Therefore, One-Life adds up to the
holistic concept of One-health by promoting our natural environment and wildlife as an ideal foundation for a functioning balanced ecosystem that benefits both animals, humans and the
environment. One-Life vision is to serve as an educational tool to better understand the fragility and beauty of our natural world by promoting wildlife and endangered species in their natural habitat
through the means of a multi-medial online archive.

Inspired by ARKive as a global initiative

ARKive was founded by Wildscreen, a UK registered educational charity based in Bristol, in 2003 and has grown to become the world's largest encyclopedia of life on earth by identifying and
collecting films, photographs and recordings of the world’s wildlife in a central digital archive of the world’s top wildlife filmmakers and photographers, conservationists, and scientists . Even though
this vision of a permanent and accessible archive of audiovisual wildlife material gained the support of many of the world's major broadcasters, it was not possible to continuously raise suffient funds
to keep ARKive alive; unfortunatley. the website was closed in February 2019.

ARKive: World’s biggest encyclopaedia of life on Earth

By the time the project started, the project team had researched, recorded, copied, described and reviewed image, sound and event records of 1,000 animals, plants and fungi, many of which are
endangered. Each month, more multimedia profiles are added, starting with the UK's flora and fauna and Red List species — those most at risk of extinction according to WUC surveys. By January
2006, the database had grown to 2,000 species, 15,000 photos and over 50 hours of video footage. By 2010, more than 5,500 donors had provided 70,000 videos and photos of more than 12,000
species. With the help of over 7,000 of the world’s best wildlife filmmakers and photographers, conservationists and scientists, Arkive featured multi-media fact-files for more than 16,000 endangered
species.
