1g, Managing, and evaluating Machine Learning workflows

eC MTurk can be a great way to minimize the costs and time required for each stage of ML development. It is easy to collect and annotate the massive amounts of data
required for training machine learning (ML) models with MTurk. Building an efficient machine learning model also requires continuous iterations and corrections.

= Another usage of MTurk for ML development is human-in-the-loop (HITL), where human feedback is used to help validate and retrain your model. An example is

drawing bounding boxes to build high-quality datasets for computer vision models, where the task might be too ambiguous for a purely mechanical solution and too

vast for even a large team of human experts.

“At Al2, we're pushing the state of the art of Artificial Intelligence, which often requires human-annotated data to train
¥ new systems and measure our progress. In particular, we use crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk to
build datasets that help our models learn common sense knowledge, which Is often necessary to answer basic questions
that are easy for humans but still quite hard for machines. Amazon Mechanical Turk provides a flexible platform that
(@) enables us to harness human knowledge to advance machine learning research.”

ALLEN INSTITUTE = Michael Schmitz, Director of Engineering, Allen Institute for Al
for ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

 

ess process outsourcing

Alarge, seemingly overwhelming task can sometimes be transformed into a set of smaller, more manageable microtasks that can each be accomplished
independently. Crowdsourcing can be an efficient organizational strategy to hamess innovation and agility by distributing work to Internet users. Businesses or
developers can use MTurk to access thousands of on-demand workers—and then integrate the results of that work directly into their business processes and systems.
Common examples include the moderation of web and social media content, categorization of products or images, and the collection of data from websites or other

resources.

“The F&B industry has always operated at the mercy of changing tastes and preferences of consumers. Our goal Is to
surface consumer insights and spot emerging trends, so our clients can effectively respond with effective strategies.
Workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk respond to our requests to gather information from menus, websites, and other
channels. We are able to leverage these human collective insights to better understand customer needs and uncover
important market trends.”

3D Bennu
Image Credit: NASA, GSFC, U. Arizona - Stereo Image Copyright: Patrick Vantuyne

 

 

Explanation: Put on your red/blue glasses and float next to asteroid 101955 Bennu. Shaped like a spinning toy top with boulders littering its rough surface, the tiny Solar System world is about one Empire State Building (less than 500 meters) across. Frames used to construct this 3D anaglyph were taken by PolyCam on the OSIRIS_REx spacecraft on December 3, 2018 from a
distance of about 80 kilometers. With a sample from the asteroid's rocky surface on board, OSIRIS_REx departed Bennu's vicinity in May of 2021 and is now enroute to planet Earth. The robotic spacecraft is scheduled to return the sample to Earth this September.

The Holistic View of Life on Earth.

 

One-Life aims to raise awareness and and promote environmental consciousness for our fragile ecosystem including animals of all species across the globe. Therefore, One-Life adds up to the
holistic concept of One-health by promoting our natural environment and wildlife as an ideal foundation for a functioning balanced ecosystem that benefits both animals, humans and the
environment. One-Life vision is to serve as an educational tool to better understand the fragility and beauty of our natural world by promoting wildlife and endangered species in their natural habitat
through the means of a multi-medial online archive.

Inspired by ARKive as a global initiative

ARKive was founded by Wildscreen, a UK registered educational charity based in Bristol, in 2003 and has grown to become the world’s largest encyclopedia of life on earth by identifying and
collecting films, photographs and recordings of the world’s wildlife in a central digital archive of the world’s top wildlife filmmakers and photographers, conservationists, and scientists . Even though
this vision of a permanent and accessible archive of audiovisual wildlife material gained the support of many of the world's major broadcasters, it was not possible to continuously raise suffient funds
to keep ARKive alive; unfortunatley. the website was closed in February 2019.

ARKive: World’s biggest encyclopaedia of life on Earth

By the time the project started, the project team had researched, recorded, copied, described and reviewed image, sound and event records of 1,000 animals, plants and fungi, many of which are
endangered. Each month, more multimedia profiles are added, starting with the UK's flora and fauna and Red List species — those most at risk of extinction according to WUC surveys. By January
2006, the database had grown to 2,000 species, 15,000 photos and over 50 hours of video footage. By 2010, more than 5,500 donors had provided 70,000 videos and photos of more than 12,000
species. With the help of over 7,000 of the world’s best wildlife filmmakers and photographers, conservationists and scientists, Arkive featured multi-media fact-files for more than 16,000 endangered
species.

Julija Simas and Peta Santos: Cosmic Cooking with the Astrologer and the Chef-Mercury 0901.2

 

Pr; To consider Mercury in cooking, does seem quite odd, until we look closer at this trickster's
associations. Mercury is the planet associated with learning, communication, cognition, and
perception, it represents how we assimilate, exchange and share information, reading, the
movement and exchange of ideas through speaking, writing & networking. As messenger of the
gods, he symbolizes our thoughts and our minds that can go anywhere!

UNDERSTANDING ASTROLOGY

Anne Whitaker: From Pisces New Moon to Aries New Moon 2023: a time for reflection, for 08.03.2023
waiting, as a New World Order emerges

How are you feeling these days? | have been - unusually for me - pretty lackadaisical,
unmotivated. Left field unpredictability, some of it welcome, some not, has been a distinct
theme. Inability to make firm plans, experiencing even tentative plans having to change...sharing
with fellow humans both locally in my small nation of Scotland, nationally in the UK, and
Internationally a general feeling that the world Is falling to bits, the Old Order is no longer
sustaining us and somehow has to change... Does any of this sound familiar?

 

Maria Blaquier: A Possible Solution to the Astrological Problem of Twins 15.02.2023

Apart from sharing genetics and DNA, twins usually have virtually identical, or at least very
similar, natal charts. From an astrological standpoint, one can expect them to share the same
personality traits and to have similar life experiences, especially since, in most cases, they also
receive the same upbringing.
