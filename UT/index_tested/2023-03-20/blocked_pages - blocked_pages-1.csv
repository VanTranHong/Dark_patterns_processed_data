Bui 1g, Managing, and evaluating Machine Learning workflows
v2
iS MTurk can be a great way to minimize the costs and time required for each stage of ML development. It is easy to collect and annotate the massive amounts of data
required for training machine learning (ML) models with MTurk. Building an efficient machine learning model also requires continuous iterations and corrections.
> Another usage of MTurk for ML development is human-in-the-loop (HITL), where human feedback is used to help validate and retrain your model. An example is

drawing bounding boxes to build high-quality datasets for computer vision models, where the task might be too ambiguous for a purely mechanical solution and too
vast for even a large team of human experts.

“At Al2, we're pushing the state of the art of Artificial Intelligence, which often requires human-annotated data to train

@ ¥ new systems and measure our progress. In particular, we use crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk to
bulld datasets that help our models learn common sense knowledge, which Is often necessary to answer basic questions
that are easy for humans but still quite hard for machines. Amazon Mechanical Turk provides a flexible platform that

Oe] enables us to harness human knowledge to advance machine learning research.”

ALLEN INSTITUTE — Michael Schmitz, Director of Engineering, Allen Institute for Al
c for ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

 

ess process outsourcing

Alarge, seemingly overwhelming task can sometimes be transformed into a set of smaller, more manageable microtasks that can each be accomplished
independently. Crowdsourcing can be an efficient organizational strategy to hamess innovation and agility by distributing work to Internet users. Businesses or
developers can use MTurk to access thousands of on-demand workers—and then integrate the results of that work directly into their business processes and systems.
Common examples include the moderation of web and social media content, categorization of products or images, and the collection of data from websites or other

resources.

“The F&B industry has always operated at the mercy of changing tastes and preferences of consumers. Our goal Is to
surface consumer insights and spot emerging trends, so our clients can effectively respond with effective strategies.
Workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk respond to our requests to gather information from menus, websites, and other
channels. We are able to leverage these human collective insights to better understand customer needs and uncover
important market trends.”

TIMELORDS COLUMN - COSMIC COOKING @
Julija Simas and Peta Santos: Cosmic Cooking with the Astrologer and the Chef-Mercury 09.01.2022

@ Px To consider Mercury in cooking, does seem quite odd, until we look closer at this trickster's
associations. Mercury is the planet associated with learning, communication, cognition, and
perception, it represents how we assimilate, exchange and share information, reading, the

Q movement and exchange of ideas through speaking, writing & networking. As messenger of the
gods, he symbolizes our thoughts and our minds that can go anywhere!

UNDERSTANDING ASTROLOGY

fe) Anne Whitaker: From Pisces New Moon to Aries New Moon 2023: a time for reflection, for 08.03.2023
waiting, as a New World Order emerges

How are you feeling these days? | have been - unusually for me - pretty lackadaisical,
unmotivated. Left field unpredictability, some of it welcome, some not, has been a distinct
theme. Inability to make firm plans, experiencing even tentative plans having to change...sharing
with fellow humans both locally in my small nation of Scotland, nationally in the UK, and
Internationally a general feeling that the world Is falling to bits, the Old Order is no longer
sustaining us and somehow has to change... Does any of this sound familiar?

 

Maria Blaquier: A Possible Solution to the Astrological Problem of Twins 15.02.2023

Apart from sharing genetics and DNA, twins usually have virtually identical, or at least very
similar, natal charts. From an astrological standpoint, one can expect them to share the same
personality traits and to have similar life experiences, especially since, in most cases, they also
receive the same upbringing.
