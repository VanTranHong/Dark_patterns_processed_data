Olympus Mons: Largest Volcano in the Solar System
Image Credit: ESA, DLR, FU Berlin, Mars Express; Processing & CC BY 2.0 License: Andrea Luck

 

Explanation: The largest volcano in our Solar System is on Mars. Although three times higher than Earth's Mount Everest, Olympus Mons will not be difficult for humans to climb because of the volcano’s shallow slopes and Mars' low gravity. Covering an area greater than the entire Hawaiian volcano chain, the slopes of Olympus Mons typically rise only a few degrees at a time.
Olympus Mons is an immense shield volcano, built long ago by fluid lava. A relatively static surface crust allowed it to build up over time. Its last eruption is thought to have been about 25 million years ago. The featured image was taken by the European Space Agency's robotic Mars Express spacecraft currently orbiting the Red Planet.

Her presence felt yet rarely embodied; her wisdom offering insight and a fresh perspective on

deeply felt matters; never one to seek acknowledgement or acclaim, this spirit guide presence

within your cosmic consciousness serves to plant liminal ideals in your mental body to enable

you to unite heaven with earth. Discovered on the 15th of February 1997, she Is the largest

known Centaur, orbiting just outside that of Saturn yet extending beyond Uranus’ perihelion,
with whom she Is a steady 4:3 orbital resonance, generating a tone akin to the 4th in contemporary musical
theory.

Most of us are familiar with the three phases or archetypes of the Divine Feminine known as
Maiden, Mother, and Crone (MMC). These “faces” of the feminine have passed to us through the
years as representing the Triple Goddess and the Moon's three phases. In this article, | will
explore why we need to retire this triune and work instead with a tetrad of Maiden, Mother,
Queen, and Crone.

The Part of Fortune Is the most well-known among the calculated points known as the Arabic
Parts or Lots. Even though it is no celestial body, | have found that they work wonders for
obtaining a fresh, empowering direction about our destiny as individuals, the path of personal

Anne Whitaker: From Pisces New Moon to Aries New Moon 2023: a time for reflection, for

How are you feeling these days? | have been - unusually for me - pretty lackadaisical,
unmotivated. Left field unpredictability, some of it welcome, some not, has been a distinct
theme. Inability to make firm plans, experiencing even tentative plans having to change...sharing
with fellow humans both locally in my small nation of Scotland, nationally in the UK, and
Internationally a general feeling that the world Is falling to bits, the Old Order is no longer
sustaining us and somehow has to change... Does any of this sound familiar?
