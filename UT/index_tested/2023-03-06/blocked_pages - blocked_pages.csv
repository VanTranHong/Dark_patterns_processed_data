The Holistic View of Life on Earth.

 

One-Life aims to raise awareness and and promote environmental consciousness for our fragile ecosystem including animals of all species across the globe. Therefore, One-Life adds up to the
holistic concept of One-health by promoting our natural environment and wildlife as an ideal foundation for a functioning balanced ecosystem that benefits both animals, humans and the
environment. One-Life vision is to serve as an educational tool to better understand the fragility and beauty of our natural world by promoting wildlife and endangered species in their natural habitat
through the means of a multi-medial online archive.

Inspired by ARKive as a global initiative

ARKive was founded by Wildscreen, a UK registered educational charity based in Bristol, in 2003 and has grown to become the world’s largest encyclopedia of life on earth by identifying and
collecting films, photographs and recordings of the world’s wildlife in a central digital archive of the world’s top wildlife filmmakers and photographers, conservationists, and scientists . Even though
this vision of a permanent and accessible archive of audiovisual wildlife material gained the support of many of the world's major broadcasters, it was not possible to continuously raise suffient funds
to keep ARKive alive; unfortunatley. the website was closed in February 2019.

ARKive: World’s biggest encyclopaedia of life on Earth

By the time the project started, the project team had researched, recorded, copied, described and reviewed image, sound and event records of 1,000 animals, plants and fungi, many of which are
endangered. Each month, more multimedia profiles are added, starting with the UK's flora and fauna and Red List species — those most at risk of extinction according to WUC surveys. By January
2006, the database had grown to 2,000 species, 15,000 photos and over 50 hours of video footage. By 2010, more than 5,500 donors had provided 70,000 videos and photos of more than 12,000
species. With the help of over 7,000 of the world’s best wildlife filmmakers and photographers, conservationists and scientists, Arkive featured multi-media fact-files for more than 16,000 endangered
species.
