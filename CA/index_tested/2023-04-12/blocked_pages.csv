Growing in containers saves space, but it's also a
smart alternative if you're restricted by shade, poor
soil, time, mobility, or climate. Container gardens can
be more productive than a regular garden, while
allowing you to avoid most pest and disease
problems. Best of all, they bring your garden up close,
creating a sense of intimacy that you may not
otherwise get.

1. An automated application review process to include all the required areas of the applicant's eligibility and qualifications for the job

2. Amanual review, by the HR Specialist, of an applicant's resume to validate the information in the application package.

83,388,"Ray Grasse: Is Modern Astrology Really More ""Vague""?

It won't come as a surprise to anyone who's followed the astrological field in recent years that
there's something of a divide between those who adhere to more traditional methods and those
practicing so-called “modern astrology"" (also sometimes referred to as “psychological
astrology’—but more on that in just a bit).

TIMELORDS MAGAZINE

Andrew Smith: Chariklo

Her presence felt yet rarely embodied; her wisdom offering insight and a fresh perspective on

deeply felt matters; never one to seek acknowledgement or acclaim, this spirit guide presence

within your cosmic consciousness serves to plant liminal ideals in your mental body to enable

you to unite heaven with earth, Discovered on the 15th of February 1997, she is the largest

known Centaur, orbiting just outside that of Saturn yet extending beyond Uranus’ perihelion,
with whom she Is a steady 4:3 orbital resonance, generating a tone akin to the 4th in contemporary musical
theory.

UNDERSTANDING ASTROLOGY

Rosana Cueto Merayo: The Part of Fortune in the houses - A refreshing look at an old calculated”

The Part of Fortune Is the most well-known among the calculated points known as the Arabic
Parts or Lots. Even though it Is no celestial body, | have found that they work wonders for
obtaining a fresh, empowering direction about our destiny as individuals, the path of personal
development that C.G. Jung called individuation.

Anne Whitaker: From Pisces New Moon to Aries New Moon 2023: a time for reflection, for
waiting, as a New World Order emerges

How are you feeling these days? | have been - unusually for me - pretty lackadaisical,
unmotivated. Left field unpredictability, some of it welcome, some not, has been a distinct
theme. Inability to make firm plans, experiencing even tentative plans having to change...sharing
with fellow humans both locally in my small nation of Scotland, nationally in the UK, and
internationally a general feeling that the world Is falling to bits, the Old Order is no longer
sustaining us and somehow has to change... Does any of this sound familiar?

Bui 1g, managing, and evaluating Machine Learning workflows

é MTurk can be a great way to minimize the costs and time required for each stage of ML development. It is easy to collect and annotate the massive amounts of data
required for training machine learning (ML) models with MTurk. Building an efficient machine learning model also requires continuous iterations and corrections.
Another usage of MTurk for ML development is human-in-the-loop (HITL), where human feedback is used to help validate and retrain your model. An example is
drawing bounding boxes to build high-quality datasets for computer vision models, where the task might be too ambiguous for a purely mechanical solution and too

vast for even a large team of human experts.

“At Al2, we're pushing the state of the art of Artificial Intelligence, which often requires human-annotated data to train
@ ¥ new systems and measure our progress. In particular, we use crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk to
build datasets that help our models learn common sense knowledge, which Is often necessary to answer basic questions
O that are easy for humans but still quite hard for machines. Amazon Mechanical Turk provides a flexible platform that
!
(2)

enables us to harness human knowledge to advance machine learning research.”

ALLEN INSTITUTE = Michael Schmitz, Director of Engineering, Allen Institute for Al
for ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

Business process outsourcing

Alarge, seemingly overwhelming task can sometimes be transformed into a set of smaller, more manageable microtasks that can each be accomplished
independently. Crowdsourcing can be an efficient organizational strategy to hamess innovation and agility by distributing work to Internet users. Businesses or
developers can use MTurk to access thousands of on-demand workers—and then integrate the results of that work directly into their business processes and systems.
Common examples include the moderation of web and social media content, categorization of products or images, and the collection of data from websites or other

resources.

“The F&B industry has always operated at the mercy of changing tastes and preferences of consumers. Our goal Is to
surface consumer insights and spot emerging trends, so our clients can effectively respond with effective strategies.

Workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk respond to our requests to gather information from menus, websites, and other
channels. We are able to leverage these human collective insights to better understand customer needs and uncover

important market trends.”
