It won't come as a surprise to anyone who's followed the astrological field in recent years that
there's something of a divide between those who adhere to more traditional methods and those
practicing so-called “modern astrology"" (also sometimes referred to as “psychological
astrology’—but more on that in just a bit).

Ray Grasse: Is Modern Astrology Really More ""Vague""? 0

TIMELORDS MAGAZINE

 

Andrew Smith: Chariklo

Her presence felt yet rarely embodied; her wisdom offering insight and a fresh perspective on

deeply felt matters; never one to seek acknowledgement or acclaim, this spirit guide presence

within your cosmic consciousness serves to plant liminal ideals in your mental body to enable

you to unite heaven with earth. Discovered on the 15th of February 1997, she Is the largest

known Centaur, orbiting just outside that of Saturn yet extending beyond Uranus’ perihelion,
with whom she Is a steady 4:3 orbital resonance, generating a tone akin to the 4th in contemporary musical
theory.

 

UNDERSTANDING ASTROLOGY

 

Rosana Cueto Merayo: The Part of Fortune in the houses - A refreshing look at an old calculated”

The Part of Fortune Is the most well-known among the calculated points known as the Arabic
Parts or Lots. Even though it is no celestial body, | have found that they work wonders for
obtaining a fresh, empowering direction about our destiny as individuals, the path of personal
development that C.G. Jung called individuation.

 

Anne Whitaker: From Pisces New Moon to Aries New Moon 2023: a time for reflection, for
waiting, as a New World Order emerges

 

How are you feeling these days? | have been - unusually for me - pretty lackadaisical,
unmotivated. Left field unpredictability, some of it welcome, some not, has been a distinct
theme. Inability to make firm plans, experiencing even tentative plans having to change...sharing
with fellow humans both locally in my small nation of Scotland, nationally in the UK, and
Internationally a general feeling that the world Is falling to bits, the Old Order is no longer
sustaining us and somehow has to change... Does any of this sound familiar?
