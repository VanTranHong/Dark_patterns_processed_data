9,255,"Artificial Creativity

Ee > iti)

 

From 2010 to 2012, filmmaker Kirby Ferguson released “Everything is a Remix,’ a four-part series (watch
here) that explored art and creativity, and particularly how artists inevitably borrow from one another,
drawing on past ideas and conventions, and then turn these materials into something beautiful and new.
In the initial series, Ferguson focused on musicians, filmmakers, writers and even video game makers.
Now, a little more than a decade later, Ferguson has resurfaced and released a fifth and final chapter in his
series, with this episode focusing on a different kind of artist: artificial intelligence. Responding to the rise
of Al-generated art, Ferguson delves into the ethics of art generated by machines, particularly when
they're trained with human-created art. Is Al-generated art a form of piracy? Or is it another kind of
creative remix? And what does Al mean for the future of art and creativity? These are just some of the
weighty questions Ferguson tackles in his final installment. Watch it above.

The EVOLVING ASTROLOGER

 

Yolanda McAdam: Reclaiming the Crown - The Archetype of the Queen

Most of us are familiar with the three phases or archetypes of the Divine Feminine known as
Maiden, Mother, and Crone (MMC). These “faces” of the feminine have passed to us through the
years as representing the Triple Goddess and the Moon's three phases. In this article, | will
explore why we need to retire this triune and work instead with a tetrad of Maiden, Mother,
Queen, and Crone.

UNDERSTANDING ASTROLOGY

 

Anne Whitaker: From Pisces New Moon to Aries New Moon 2023: a time for reflection, for
waiting, as a New World Order emerges

How are you feeling these days? | have been - unusually for me - pretty lackadaisical,
unmotivated. Left field unpredictability, some of it welcome, some not, has been a distinct
theme. Inability to make firm plans, experiencing even tentative plans having to change...sharing
with fellow humans both locally in my small nation of Scotland, nationally in the UK, and
Internationally a general feeling that the world Is falling to bits, the Old Order is no longer
sustaining us and somehow has to change... Does any of this sound familiar?

 

 

Maria Blaquier: A Possible Solution to the Astrological Problem of Twins

Apart from sharing genetics and DNA, twins usually have virtually identical, or at least very
similar, natal charts. From an astrological standpoint, one can expect them to share the same
personality traits and to have similar life experiences, especially since, in most cases, they also
receive the same upbringing.
