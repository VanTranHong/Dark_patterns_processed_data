Bui 1g, Managing, and evaluating Machine Learning workflows

eC MTurk can be a great way to minimize the costs and time required for each stage of ML development. It is easy to collect and annotate the massive amounts of data
required for training machine learning (ML) models with MTurk. Building an efficient machine learning model also requires continuous iterations and corrections.
Another usage of MTurk for ML development is human-in-the-loop (HITL), where human feedback is used to help validate and retrain your model. An example is
drawing bounding boxes to build high-quality datasets for computer vision models, where the task might be too ambiguous for a purely mechanical solution and too
vast for even a large team of human experts.

“At Al2, we're pushing the state of the art of Artificial Intelligence, which often requires human-annotated data to train
¥ new systems and measure our progress. In particular, we use crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk to

build datasets that help our models learn common sense knowledge, which Is often necessary to answer basic questions
that are easy for humans but still quite hard for machines. Amazon Mechanical Turk provides a flexible platform that
(@) enables us to harness human knowledge to advance machine learning research.”

ALLEN INSTITUTE = Michael Schmitz, Director of Engineering, Allen Institute for Al
for ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

 

ess process outsourcing

Alarge, seemingly overwhelming task can sometimes be transformed into a set of smaller, more manageable microtasks that can each be accomplished
independently. Crowdsourcing can be an efficient organizational strategy to hamess innovation and agility by distributing work to Internet users. Businesses or
developers can use MTurk to access thousands of on-demand workers—and then integrate the results of that work directly into their business processes and systems.
Common examples include the moderation of web and social media content, categorization of products or images, and the collection of data from websites or other
resources.

“The F&B industry has always operated at the mercy of changing tastes and preferences of consumers. Our goal Is to
surface consumer insights and spot emerging trends, so our clients can effectively respond with effective strategies.
Workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk respond to our requests to gather information from menus, websites, and other
channels. We are able to leverage these human collective insights to better understand customer needs and uncover
important market trends.”

~ David Falck, Executive Director, Food Genius / US Foods Data Science
